## 10/13/2025 3 PM - Brainstormed ideas and selected a few parts  

OK, so, for starters, I brainstormed the first ideas on the project, mostly by myself, but with some help from the Glasgow's community. I've arrived at what I would consider more or less a rough idea of what I want to make. I want to be able to interface with up to 32-pin chips, by using a simple ZFS. Sadly, the Glasgow revC3 only has 16 total channels, coming 8 from each port. To solve this issue, I've decided on using the TMUX1209 Bidirectional Multiplexers. Not only are they cheap and tiny, but there's also two hidden features that make these the perfect candidates. First, they're 2-Channel. Each channel can control up to 4 IOs. This means that with only two of these chips and 4 IOs + 3 for the enable and address pins, I have more than enough for the entire 16 pins each port needs to handle, and I can theoretically get double the speed when reading/writing than with single channel multiplexers. I even have one free IO I can hookup to an LED or whatever I want. Probably will be NC though. Apart from this, they're also CMOS multiplexers, so they can work with 1.8V logic, which is one of the many features I adore about the Glasgow Interface Explorer. Keeping that feature makes this a match made in heaven.

In other news, I was also thinking on how to handle choosing where pins were connected to. The solution I think I'm going to go with, is give each pin a jumper. Depending on the position, each pin will be able to be connected to either VIO, GND, its respective multiplexer IO, or VSENSE, so I can measure DAC signals and similar. This is the cheapest, and probably most effective solution, though a part of me fears it might not be compact enough. We'll see once I actually go to design the circuit. For now, I still need to think about how to layout and connect everything, and ensure I get all the dimensions right. Let's hope that goes alright...![imagen.png](https://blueprint.hackclub.com/user-attachments/blobs/proxy/eyJfcmFpbHMiOnsiZGF0YSI6MTk5MCwicHVyIjoiYmxvYl9pZCJ9fQ==--2801182b05fb1d1239370fe12c2ed0f3f6014880/imagen.png)
  

## 10/13/2025 5 PM - Added Port A and Port B to schematic  

So, I have started setting up the schematic for the board. I had to search for a connector to interface with the Glasgow, and had to import those files, plus the TMUX1209, since KiCad only includes files for the TMUX1208, and they are pin incompatible. After that slight mishap, I went on to set up the Port A and Port B connectors with a few labels and ground connections. I've decided I'm going to route the PCB with a big groundplane, which will be connected to the NC pins too, just to be safe. I really do hope that does not cause any problems down the line lol. Anyways, it doesn't seem like much loooking back at it, but I've been working non stop since the last journal entry, so this is probably as far as I'm gonna go today. I need my rest too, after all! :D

## 10/15/2025 4:00 PM - ZIF Socket and multiplexers  

After a bit of searching around for a good and cheap ZIF Socket (which took over 5 hours by itself because Amazon, Mouser, and DigiKey are all overpriced, I don't trust AliBaba or TEMU, and AliExpress is a pain to browse), I got it down and added it to the schematic. I also added the four multiplexers I need to fill out the 32 pins I want to have access to. I have wired the enable pin of each of them to a pull-up 10k resistor, with the possibility to put a jumper (or a cable, wink wink) to ground. This is because I don't really have a use for the enable pin being off, but I don't want to lose support for it. This is the most flexible option, since it lets me have as much as 4 IOs free on the Glasgow, whilst alos letting me choose to enable or disable the chips. I have also decided, after a bit of brainstorming, that I'm gonna make two slight changes to my design. First of all, the entirety of the ports of the Glasgow should be exposed. This is mainly so I can still access the four unused IOs, but it also gives room to a new idea. Instead of having to break or make bridges, I will just use wires to jump connections. That said, wires have a problem. They have higher resistance than the PCB, and clutter up, which is the exact reason I wanted to make this PCB, so it wouldn't be cluttery or require much setup. So, instead, I'm planning on making it so by default, the connections are made to the multiplexers. If I don't want to use the multiplexers, I can just put the four jumpers for them to be disabled, and jump my own cables however I want, which is BEAUTIFUL, for so many applications, and the least problematic solution I could find. I'm kinda proud of myself ngl uwu (This took way too long to think of, help) ![Captura de pantalla 2025-10-15 154740.png](https://blueprint.hackclub.com/user-attachments/blobs/proxy/eyJfcmFpbHMiOnsiZGF0YSI6MjM0OCwicHVyIjoiYmxvYl9pZCJ9fQ==--02ca011d1029c5a7d0433c32012bc0526c9dc16a/Captura%20de%20pantalla%202025-10-15%20154740.png)
  

## 10/15/2025 4:54 PM - Finished Schematic  

Welp, I finally did it! I finished the schematic! There's still PCB routing and a looot more to do but like, this is the first step on this great little adventure! I have also decided to do devlogs every 1 or 2 hours because I feel like that 8h devlog is gonna come back and haunt me at shipping time. Anyways, now I still have to check a few things, and I'll probably ask some people for a revision over my schematic. Apart from that, we're almost there to making the PCB!!! :D

## 10/20/2025 4 PM - Layed out the footprints for the PCB  

OK this was kinda hard ngl. I had to fit a lot of stuff, and since I wanted to use through-hole resistors (I have them at home so I don't have to buy new resistors), the space was kinda cramped. I also needed some measures to be precise, so I could actually plug this in. That was kinda hard and gave me even more constraining, which is never good. I had to end up pulling the official Glasgow's PCB layout just so I could actually take measurements and ensure everything would be alright. After all that, I chose footprints, I layed out components, and tweaked it to make my job easier later. I wanted to do this devlog with the routing too, but the clock was at 4h 53mins since last devlog soooo, here we are lol. Now I have to make the holes to be able to screw the board to the Glasgow with some risers, and then I will start routing the PCB. See ya then! :D

## 10/20/2025 10 PM - Finished the PCB design  

I finally finished the PCB design!!! It has been an arduous process, if I'm going to be completely honest with you. I had to redo the layout and wiring THREE FU****G TIMES. WHAT THE F***. Anyways, as I was saying, it has been quite the ride, and now all that's left is just cleaning a bit of the GitHub repo, searching for a few parts that I want to find for cheaper, and that should be about it. So yeah, let's hope it goes well, and that I can ship soon!

If I end up spending over an hour on the rest of  this, I will make sure to make a devlog about it lol. I need all the hours I can possibly get >:3

## 10/21/2025 11 AM - We're ready for production! :D  

OK, so, turns out, there was still quite a good chunk of job left done to do XD. I re-positioned some stuff, and then thought I was finished. Turns out, I was wrong. After adding silkscreens and doing everything again (which took the better part of half an hour alone), I had to fight a bit to get DRC to comply. Once that was done, though, I did a render, updated the README, and put the render in the README. (Sorry for the lack of some components, but my free time and will to do minor stuff is NOT infinite).

![Board 3D render](https://blueprint.hackclub.com/user-attachments/blobs/proxy/eyJfcmFpbHMiOnsiZGF0YSI6NDAwMCwicHVyIjoiYmxvYl9pZCJ9fQ==--07cea308ae84a406cb6f8766f403f5408a8156fb/render.jpg)

And, after all that, I still had to go and check that my supplies were the cheapest (and most reliable) I could get. After ALL that, and three hours extra of my life spent on this "little silly project", I've finally been able to upload them to JLCPCB, and put down an order. Since I want this project only for the tickets, and I don't need a grant, I won't be shipping it until I have it fully assembled. Which means, now I've got to order the PCB and all the parts I need for it, which is gonna be *fun*, I'm sure. Hey, worst case scenario, I get an extra hour out of it, right? Right...?

## 10/21/2025 10 PM - Bought everything!  

So, in total, this has bitten out almost 80€ from my wallet. That kinda hurt, but I'm not gonna lie, I also got myself a soldering mat, a vacuum picker, some rosin paste, and some solder paste, because I kinda needed them. Still, WOW THAT WAS A LOT OF MONEY :'(

Hopefully the awesome reviewers will take it into account when reviewing my project though!!! :D (I really badly want tickets for the CNC machine ngl ngl)

Anyways, this all took around 2 hours, mainly cause I had to search for a good non-leaded solder paste and rosin, and I wanted to make sure the orders were alright and shit. So yeah, all in all, this was quite tedious and expensive. More so than I would have wanted, in fact... Welp, that's life, I guess...

## 10/31/2025 - All the components are here! (Except the PCBs :<)  

Well so that was quite the wait! But we finally have everything here! The DigiKey stuff arrived last week, but the ZIF sockets from AliExpress just arrived today! They are really cool, and work just as expected. They fit all the chips I want to use with this adapter for now, and even some extras. So I'm very happy with them. The only problem was that they came unprotected in individual plastic bags, so I had to fix some bent (and luckily none bent) pins. I also decided to put them on some packing foam I had around to avoid any more mischief from them, and threw out the undersized plastic bags.

![ZIF sockets over the packing foam](https://blueprint.hackclub.com/user-attachments/blobs/proxy/eyJfcmFpbHMiOnsiZGF0YSI6Njk1MywicHVyIjoiYmxvYl9pZCJ9fQ==--1fbd8bd8de2bb6c51d47cd483c0f046e85358840/IMG20251031120705.jpg)

Between this and organizing all the items that arrived from DigiKey, it took me a good hour of work, maybe even more, so that's how this journal is justified. The PCBs should arrive next week, since they are already in France, and hopefully I can get assembling, testing, and coding as soon as possible. I am very excited about this! :D
